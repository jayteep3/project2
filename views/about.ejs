<h1> The shelter</h1>

<p>This site is designed to help find animals homes! We link shelters, volunteers, and adopters together to create an easy to volunteer or adopt experience.
    You can find information about what animals are up for adoption and where, as well as information about volunteering at your local shelter today! </p>
